## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The requirements of this Android Application were: 
    - Registering a new user
    - Login/password validation
    - SMS Alerts 
    - Add/ Updating / Deleting items
    - Requesting / Checking for permissions

  The main screens that crucial for this application were the login, registration, and inventory list screens. 
  
## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  
  I took on an iterative approach to desigin and coding this application. There were a lot of requirements that needed to broken down into smaller goals and tasks.

## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

  Running and testing the application was crucial for ensuring no errors occured during normal use - such as login in a user. This is important for avoiding any potential security vulnerabilities or creating a less than desireable user experience.

## Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  I had to simply UI components, but still keeping the same functionality. I originally planned to use checkboxes, but I eventually decided adding buttons to handle delete events was much more streamlined.

  My understanding of Object Oriented Programming and the Java programming language.
